# EcoCar/KiCad Electrical Parts Library
This repository is dedicated to making a parts library for electrical components used in EcoCar. By standardizing all the parts we use in the club, we can make ordering processes easier. It will be up for debate whether or not we standardize chip resistors and multi-layer ceramic capacitors (MLCC). 

The primary purpose is to cover significant components like inductors, operational amplifiers, power regulators, and others not native to the KiCad standard library. We should, however, save any parts used from the KiCad standard library if it is not something simple like a chip resistor or MLCC. Diodes should be included in the EcoCar standard parts library.
